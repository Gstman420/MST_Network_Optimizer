# 🌐 MST Network Optimizer using Kruskal's Algorithm

This project demonstrates a **cost-effective network design** using **Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithm** in **C**, integrated with a **Flask + HTML frontend** for interactive input and visualization.

It models real-world applications like **internet cabling**, **power grid layout**, and **transport route optimization**, where planners aim to connect all cities with **minimum total cost** while avoiding redundant connections.

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used — Kruskal's MST

Kruskal's Algorithm follows a **Greedy Approach** to build the MST:

1. Sort all edges by their connection cost (ascending order)
2. Pick the smallest edge that doesn't form a cycle (using Union–Find)
3. Repeat until all cities are connected

### ⚙️ Algorithmic Concepts

- **Graph Representation:** Weighted Undirected Graph
- **Cycle Detection:** Union–Find (Disjoint Set Union)
- **Time Complexity:** `O(E log E)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(V + E)`

## ⚡ Features

- Interactive web input for cities and connection costs
- C backend ensures high-speed computation
- Flask server bridges frontend and algorithm logic
- Displays MST edges and total minimum cost
- Simulates real-world cost optimization problems

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Step 1️⃣ — Compile the C backend

```bash
gcc mst_backend.c -o mst_backend
```

### Step 2️⃣ — Start the Flask server

```bash
python server.py
```

### Step 3️⃣ — Open in your browser

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Step 4️⃣ — Enter Data

- Enter the **number of cities**
- Enter the **connection costs** between each city pair (`0` if no direct connection)
- Click **Compute MST**

## 📈 Example Input

```
Number of Cities: 4
0 ↔ 1 : 10
0 ↔ 2 : 6
0 ↔ 3 : 5
1 ↔ 2 : 0
1 ↔ 3 : 15
2 ↔ 3 : 4
```

## 📊 Example Output

```
## 🌐 Minimum Spanning Tree (Optimal Network):

Connect City 2 ↔ City 3   | Cost: 4
Connect City 0 ↔ City 3   | Cost: 5
Connect City 0 ↔ City 1   | Cost: 10
------------------------------------

✅ Total Minimum Cable Cost: 19
